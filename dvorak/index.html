  <p>Changed to Dvorak. Pray for me.</p>
<p>Update (2020-04-25): I tried Dvorak for one week and went back to Qwerty.</p>
<p>This one week on Dvorak was very important in my vision. As the layout was
completely different, it made me truly start to type without looking on the
keyboard. It made me enter the muscle-memory thing for good.</p>
<p>But it wasn't all flowers: even if I didn't touch-type with Qwerty before, I had
a strong (bad) muscle-memory from where the keys were placed. Because of this,
even quickly getting the keys positions, I had a very hard time improving speed.
In fact, I constantly got myself stopping the automatic-muscle-memory-driven
typing because my old Qwerty muscle-memory placed my fingers on the wrong key.
So I went back to Qwerty, and a great thing happened: I quickly got my muscle-memory
back in place, was typing fast and was improving fast, at the point that I finished
the 90 lessons in 1 hour (I usually did half of that with Dvorak).</p>
<p>Now I am at about 50 wpm on regular typing and about half of that on coding.</p>
